# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-with-SMOTE
I used data which has 284807 entry and 28 attributes. I tried to detect fraud. I applied Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN, Gradient Boosting and SVM. As a result Random Forest and XGBoost gave the best accuracy score. But because of the imbalanced data, I used SMOTE technique to apply XGBoost and Random Forest again. After re-sampling F1 score was acceptable. So, XGBoost can be preffered because it is faster than the Random Forest.
